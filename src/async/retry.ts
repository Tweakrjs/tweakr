/**
 * Retries an asynchronous operation a specified number of times with delay between attempts.
 *
 * This utility is useful for handling transient errors (e.g., network requests)
 * by automatically retrying the provided async function on failure.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * let attempt = 0;
 * const result = await retry(async () => {
 *   if (attempt++ < 2) throw new Error("Failed");
 *   return "Success";
 * }, 3, 200);
 *
 * console.log(result); // "Success"
 * ```
 *
 * @template T - The type of the resolved value from the async function.
 * @param fn - The asynchronous function to retry.
 * @param retries - Maximum number of retry attempts. Defaults to `3`.
 * @param delay - Delay in milliseconds between retries. Defaults to `100`.
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the functionâ€™s result, or rejects after all retries fail.
 *
 * @throws Will throw the last encountered error after exhausting all retries.
 *
 * @category Async
 * @since 1.1.0
