# Tweakr

**A modern, modular utility library for JavaScript and TypeScript** — functional, async, and immutable helpers.

## **Features (Planned)**

- Modular, one-function-per-file structure
- Fully TypeScript-ready
- Functional helpers like `pipe` and `compose`
- Async helpers for modern workflows
- Immutable object utilities
- Core array, string, number, object, and function helpers
- Tree-shakable and lightweight
